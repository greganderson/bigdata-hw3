# bigdata-hw3

Instructions on how to run:

Run:
	spark-submit parse.py &lt;search_term&gt;

Where &lt;search_term&gt; is the term you want to search on.

Make sure that you have the directory of small_pages in the same working
directory.  If you want to use the cluster, use parse-big.py.  That is set to
use the cluster hdfs.

The results will be returned in a format suitable for programmers.  A demo of
the web version will be showed at another time where the results will be a
little more human usable.
